Dedicated to the people who are being/have been assaulted by someone. It is time to speak up.

In this Project: We are trying to create a community for the people who can talk about their problems without being judged by anyone. 
In this Project:
1. Website interface
2. Live Chat with strangers
3. Mod/Superhero/Helpers/Contributor with badges
4. Users can create/update posts/pics/videos of their stories/problems
5. Communities can be divided by the preferred language of the user.
6. Communities can be filtered by country/continent
7. Mods can update/ban/delete user posts.
8. Superheros can update/ban/delete user posts and they will be visible in their region (if online)
9. Superheros are rare so they can be contacted anytime by anyone*
(Anyone who posts anything has to wait at least 30 minutes before contacting superheroes)
10. Mods can update/create new topics/problems/issues/help requests/Updates
11. Help in crisis platform details and direct contact with those services
12. Chat and Topics can be moved to the subreddit r/NoMoreAssault (only if there is a Reddit API available)
13. Reddit Conversations can be escalated to the website if needed (only mods)
14. Help section for the people in need (new articles and blogs / filtered by every country/location)
15. Qualified volunteers for people in need (Who can talk to the victims, make them feel comfortable and finally reach out to a local authority)
16. Fund-raising to pay the basic hosting and other charges and to promote this platform and make it accessible for everyone in every country 
17. Every piece of information provided by the user is a matter of life and death. We as a supporting team should respect that. Only the superheroes and Superadmins are allowed to see it to monitor how are our volunteers performing.
